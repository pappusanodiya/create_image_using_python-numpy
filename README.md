# 🌅 Capturing the Beauty of a Sunrise with Code! 🌄

In this picturesque scene, we've harnessed the power of Python and Matplotlib to create a stunning sunrise. Let's break it down:

# 🎨 Color Palette:

The sky radiates in a soothing light blue (#87CEEB).
The sun shines brightly in vibrant yellow (#FFD700).
Lush greenery adorns the mountains and earth surface (#008000 and #228B22).
The sea sparkles with a serene blue (#6495ED).

# 🌊 Natural Elements:

The sea is represented with a blue rectangle.
The earth surface is the green rectangle below the sea.
A large, radiant sun graces the sky.

# ⛰️ Majestic Mountains:

Three mountains stand tall in various shades of green.
Heights and positions of the mountains vary for a natural look.

# ✨ Creating the Scene:

The code utilizes Matplotlib for visualization.
We set background colors and created shapes for each element.
